There are other files in here for documentation purposes to show process. This took me a while to make the connections to create the game music maker file.

## 🎮 What is this?

The **Quantum Retro Composer** is a Python-based audio engine that generates unique, copyright-free, seamless background music for retro-style video games (SNES, Genesis, Indie).

Unlike standard random generators, this tool uses a sophisticated pipeline to ensure musicality and "soul":
1.  **Quantum Entropy:** It harvests real-time quantum vacuum fluctuations from the ANU Quantum Numbers API to seed the generator.
2.  **AI Composition:** It uses **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** to write the "sheet music" (JSON), handling music theory, syncopation, and song structure.
3.  **DSP Synthesis:** It renders the audio from scratch using pure mathematics (NumPy), applying retro oscillators (Square/Triangle/Saw waves) and bit-crushing effects.

## ✨ Features

* **Infinite Variety:** No two tracks are ever mathematically identical.
* **Seamless Looping:** Algorithms ensure the output loops perfectly with no clicks or gaps.
* **Evolving Structure:** Generates tracks with distinct phases (Intro, Build-up, Climax/Boss Mode).
* **Retro Aesthetic:** Built-in "Bitcrusher" and 16-bit synthesis emulation.
* **Density Enforcement:** Smart logic prevents "sparse" or silent sections by injecting filler beats when the AI gets too abstract.
* **Zero Samples:** No external MP3s or WAVs required. The sound is synthesized in real-time.
